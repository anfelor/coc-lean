# A calculus of constructions in Lean

This implements a simple type theory in Lean.
It contains expression with de-bruijn variables, fresh variable generation
and a type checker.

If you intend to use this contact me with questions or ask me to add some comments.

## Roadmap

 - I really want to have some category instances for Judgement. Some definitions for this
   have been provided.
 - I want to try and turn this into a small Haskell-like programming language with
   a parser for simple function definitions and data types.
 - Maybe everything will be easier once Lean 4 lands?
